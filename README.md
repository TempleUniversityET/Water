# Water
moved repository from personal to organization

second tesh push in to project //if you need help just ask. 

we want to be able to fork repositories between github/android studio.

here is a link that will help so we can stay up to date on the most recent changes to any code we make and how to push/pull and fork.

https://github.com/makersinstitute/android-academy/blob/master/projects/w1d3%20-%20Collaboration%20using%20GitHub%20and%20Android%20Studio.md

this is just a sample project upload ive done and not the final one.

we can practice with the Capstone_Water_App repository I posted.

we need to decide as a group what to code in kotlan or java.

what features were are adding. what modules each personal is working on, etc..

let me know what you all think
